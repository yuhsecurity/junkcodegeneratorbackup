PHP-C++-JunkCodeGenerator
========================

This project is a C++ junkcode class generator, which will generate random classes.
It's written in PHP, so you can host it on your webserver.

See example.php or example.cpp for usage and results.

[You can see the script in action on my website](http://junkcode.gehaxelt.in/)

Have fun using it.
